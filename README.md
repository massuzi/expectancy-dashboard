# 📊 Expectancy Dashboard

This project analyzes trading performance using Python and Excel based on Discord-logged trades.

It calculates R-multiples per trade, win rates, and expectancy (the average return per unit risk).  
The goal is to quantify performance over time and reduce emotion in decision-making through structured journaling.
